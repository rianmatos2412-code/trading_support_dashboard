Swing High/Low Detection Module

This module provides functions to detect swing highs and lows in price data,
which are used to identify key price levels for trading strategies.

A swing high is a local maximum where the price is higher than surrounding bars.
A swing low is a local minimum where the price is lower than surrounding bars.

    Calculate swing highs and swing lows in a DataFrame using a rolling window approach.

    A swing high is a high that is higher than 'window' bars before and after it.
    A swing low is a low that is lower than 'window' bars before and after it.

    Args:
        df: DataFrame with 'high' and 'low' columns (case-sensitive lowercase).
            Must contain numeric data. Should also have 'unix' column for datetime.

                A window of 2 means 2 bars before and 2 bars after (total 5 bars).

        tuples of (datetime, price). datetime is Unix timestamp from the 'unix' column.
